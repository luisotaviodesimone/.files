This is the repository to host my automatic initial configuration to my Windows developing environment

## Setup
1. First you should set you execution policy to `Bypass` in order to run the script:
```

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass

```

3. Download the repository, and since is not expected for you to have `git` installed, follow the guide below

2. After that, since it is a automatic setup, when you download the repository you should just `cd` into the directory and run `./first_configs.ps1`
3. Don't forget to go [here](https://github.com/romkatv/dotfiles-public/tree/master/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts) to download the NerdFonts and install it.
4. If you want to install my personal tools you can run the `./personal_tools.ps1`
