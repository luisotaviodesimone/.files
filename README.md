This is the repository to host my automatic initial configuration to my windows developing environment

## Setup
1. First you should set you execution policy to `Bypass` in order to run the script:
```

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass

```

3. Download the repository, and since is not expected for you to have `git` installed, follow the guide below

2. After that, since it is a automatic setup, when you download the repository you should just `cd` into the directory and run `first_config.ps1`
